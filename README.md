RFI Mitigation using Unet
=====
Github Repo for the Image Segmentation project by AAC NITK as part of Astro
Committee, Engineer '16 - 17.

We will use Deep Learning for RFI mitigation.

_**THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS**_

## Roadmap

* **Step 1.** **[IN PROGRESS]** Processing Bleien Survey Data Images using SEEK.
* **Step 2.** **[IN PROGRESS]** Visualise processed data to ensure that we are
  dealing with the right type of data.
* **Step 3.** **[IN PROGRESS]** Train naive Unet on the data taht has been
  processed.
* **Step 4.** **[IN PROGRESS]** Generate more data using HIDE and process with
  SEEK.
* **Step 5.** Train on the extended dataset and observe results.
* **Step 6.** Train using the Keras model.
